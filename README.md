# miwifitool-debrick-xiaomi
mifiwitool is an emergency tool used to recover (debrick) Xiaomi routers that fail to boot properly (bricked) or get stuck during custom firmware installation (e.g., OpenWRT or Padavan). It's mainly used for Xiaomi MiWiFi routers like the Mi Router 3, 3G, 4A, and others.

What It Is & What It Does
This is a Chinese‑language Windows executable provided by Xiaomi, typically named something like MiWiFi Repair Tool or Xiaomi …修复工具.exe. It’s used to help unbrick Xiaomi MiWiFi routers when they fail to boot or get stuck during firmware update or flashing.

Essentially, it uploads a firmware image (China or Global version) via LAN/TFTP recovery, allowing the bootloader to re-flash the device and restore operation.

# How It Works
You run the Windows .exe tool, typically Chinese‑only interface, which may trigger antivirus warnings because it’s not digitally signed. Many users report Windows Defender flags it as malware, but it’s generally considered safe if from an official or known source. 

The tool communicates over LAN via TFTP or Breed recovery mode—similarly to mifiwitool on Linux—but packaged in a GUI Windows tool.

You must install Qualcomm, EDL, or MiWiFi router drivers properly. Some users have had issues with installation and error messages in Chinese.

# Intended Use Cases
Router stuck with a blinking or solid LED and no boot

Failed firmware update (e.g. switching from stock to custom firmware or vice versa)

No access via web interface or SSH

Standard TFTP recovery bus or bootloader not accessible

# Steps to Use the Tool (Windows Chinese .exe)
Download the tool — It’s usually packaged in a ZIP file named something like MIWIFIRepairTool.x86.zip, available from Xiaomi or trusted mirror sites.

Disable driver signature enforcement in Windows — This may be necessary because the drivers included with the tool are often unsigned.

Install Qualcomm / EDL / Router drivers — These drivers are required for the tool to communicate with your router during recovery.

Extract the downloaded ZIP to a simple path such as C:\MiRepair — Avoid using spaces or Chinese characters in the folder name.

Run the .exe file as administrator — The interface will be in Chinese.

Inside the tool, select the firmware (.bin file, either China or Global version) and begin the flashing process. You will likely click a button labeled “刷机” (flash) or “恢复” (recover).

Wait for the process to complete, then force-reset the router. It should reboot with a working firmware installed.

# PLEASE NOTE THAT THE XIAOMI FIRMWARE MENTIONED IS FOR TWO DIFFERENT MODELS: ONE IS FOR THE R4AC MODEL, AND THE OTHER IS FOR THE GIGABIT VERSION MODEL. THESE FIRMWARE VERSIONS CONTAIN VULNERABILITIES COMPATIBLE WITH THE HACK OPENWRT EXPLOIT.
